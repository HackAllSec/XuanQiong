# Summary

## English | [简体中文](README.md)

**XuanQiong（玄穹）** is a high-performance open-source vulnerability library platform for small and medium-sized teams that need to build an internal vulnerability knowledge base, retain vulnerability assets, and manage review workflows. It supports vulnerability submission, review, search, rankings, action-level RBAC, operation audit logs, in-site messages, Webhook pushes, API keys, data backup/restore, and brand customization.

## Technology stack and functionality

### Frontend

- Vite
- Vue3
- Element Plus
- TypeScript

### Backend

- Gin
- GORM
- JWT (internal session token signing and validation)

Supports databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite3, and SQL Server. See the GORM documentation for the full database compatibility list.
Browser application sessions use `X-Auth-Token`, automation integrations use `X-API-Key`, and `Authorization` is reserved for proxy-layer capabilities such as reverse proxy Basic Auth.
See [Score Rules](ScoreRules.md) for built-in vulnerability types, scoring rules, and point calculation rules.

Ordinary user accounts：test/123456

### v1.1.1 Highlights

- Added action-level RBAC, dynamic permission menus, operation audit logs, and brand customization.
- Added in-site messages, Webhook event pushes, vulnerability CSV import/export, API keys, and data backup/restore.
- Hardened authentication header isolation, attachment access control, captcha rate limiting, audit log redaction, import/export, backup/restore, and API key scope controls.
- Fixed frontend navigation branding, login footer placement, admin sidebar collapse control, and empty-state layout.
- First startup now generates a random administrator password and requires password change after first login. Fixed default public credentials are no longer documented.

### Security and operation capabilities

|Function|Description|Status|
|-|-|-|
|Application auth header isolation|The application layer only uses `X-Auth-Token`, avoiding conflicts with reverse proxy Basic Auth in the `Authorization` header|✅|
|Initial administrator password|A random administrator password is generated on first startup, and password change is required after login|✅|
|Forced re-login|Existing tokens are invalidated after password changes or role/permission changes|✅|
|Attachment access control|Attachment downloads are checked against vulnerability visibility, submitter, and management permissions|✅|
|Captcha rate limiting|Captcha requests are protected by email, IP, and global rate limits|✅|
|Sensitive data masking|System configuration, audit logs, and response records mask tokens, passwords, secrets, and similar sensitive data|✅|
|Upload limits|Vulnerability attachments are restricted by type and size, currently up to 10 MB|✅|
|API key authentication|Supports long-lived `X-API-Key` tokens. The server stores only hashes, and plaintext is shown once on creation|✅|
|Vulnerability import/export|Supports admin CSV import/export. Imported data enters the unaudited workflow by default|✅|
|Data backup and restore|Supports admin JSON backup export and restore, protected by the `backup.manage` permission|✅|

### Recently Completed Capabilities

|Function|Current status|Description|
|-|-|-|
|In-site message center|Implemented|A message is created after vulnerability review; the frontend supports listing messages and marking them as read.|
|Event push messages|Implemented|After vulnerability review, DingTalk or WxWork Webhook notifications are sent according to system settings.|
|Vulnerability import/export|Implemented|The admin panel supports CSV import/export, and imported vulnerabilities enter the unaudited state by default.|
|API keys / personal access tokens|Implemented|Users can create, view, and delete personal API keys; API calls use `X-API-Key`.|
|Data backup and restore|Implemented|The admin panel supports JSON backup export and restore, protected by RBAC permissions.|

## Deployment method

XuanQiong supports both integrated frontend/backend deployment and separated frontend/backend deployment. It has been tested with MySQL and SQLite; MySQL is recommended for production. If you encounter problems, refer to the [FAQ](FAQ.md).

When using SQLite, set `CGO_ENABLED=1` and rebuild. Release binaries are compiled with `CGO_ENABLED=0`.

### Integrated frontend/backend

This is the default startup mode:
- Modify the database configuration in `config.yaml`; the database is created automatically during initialization when supported by the selected database type.
- Run `go run main.go` or use a release binary.

After startup, an admin password will be randomly generated. After logging in with that password for the first time, the administrator is forced to change it.

### Separated frontend/backend

The user frontend and admin frontend are independent and can be deployed to different web directories. The backend service switches startup mode through the `start_mode` parameter in `config.yaml`.

- Configure the frontend `baseURL` in `src/api.ts`, then build the frontend.
- The compiled user frontend files are located in `frontend/dist`; copy the files to the target web directory.
- The compiled admin frontend files are located in `admin/dist`; copy the files to the target web directory.
- Configure backend CORS and startup mode by setting `start_mode`, `allow_origins`, `allow_methods`, and `allow_headers` in `config.yaml`, then start the backend.
